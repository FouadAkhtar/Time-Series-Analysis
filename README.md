# Time-Series-Analysis
This project involves the application of time series forecasting techniques, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) models. The dataset used for analysis contains air quality index (AQI) data, and the goal is to predict future AQI values based on historical observations.
